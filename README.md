# Angular-Springboot-Demo (BeanList)
After spending the past two years coding backends in almost exclusively Python and Javascript I wanted to try my hand at Springboot. In the same vein after having not used Angular in over a year I wanted a refresher so I decided to combine the two into an easy project. 
I made a classic "list style" web app using Postgresql as the DB. This web app is made to track coffee shops users have been to.
